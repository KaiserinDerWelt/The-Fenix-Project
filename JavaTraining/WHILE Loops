while loops are used when you know the final state you’d like to achieve, but you don’t know how many iterations (repeats) you’ll need to get there.

Keep going and going until you’ve reached the end condition!!

WHILE Loop: Should continue repeating BUT  is not infinite till the condition is acomplish.
