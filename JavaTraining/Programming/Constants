Constant
A variable with a constant value is called a constant. 
Constants are described by three components: name, value, and type. 
The only difference is that once you set it, the value of a constant cannot be changed.

To declare a constant in Java, you need to use the keyword FINAL

Example:
Final Int Pi=3.1416;
