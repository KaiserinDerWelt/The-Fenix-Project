// Declare the variable
int[] HoursOfStudyPerWeek;

// Create the array and assign it to the variable

int [] MyArray = new Int [10];  --> [0][1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9]

String [] Songs = new String [6]; [0][1][2][3][4][5]


// Assign the value 3 to the fifth day of the week
// That's index 4, since the first index is 0
cupsOfCoffeePerDayOfTheWeek[4]=3; 

System.Out.PrintIn(cupsOfCoffeePerDayOfTheWeek[0]);

// Create a multidimensional array to manage all the rows of a theater
String[][] myTheatreSeats=new String[30][12];
