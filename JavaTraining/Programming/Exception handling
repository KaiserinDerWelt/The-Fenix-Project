The exception handling mechanism is the default error-management mechanism in Java. It consists of throwing an event that interrupts the normal flow of execution when a problem occurs. If this event is caught, the problem can be dealt with. 
Otherwise, the program crashes with a stack trace that describes what happened.

By catching an error (even though you did nothing), you prevented the app from crashing.

try {
// some code
// a function to try that can generate an error
// more code
}
catch (ExceptionName e) {
// code to execute in case the trial didn't work out and an error happened
}
