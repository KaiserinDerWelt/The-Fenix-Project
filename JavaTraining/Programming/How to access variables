To access to a variable it must be in its code block because is the scope of the variable.
Access level: Reinforce accesibility to extend the attribute of an instance.

Each variable is only available (and accessible) in the context within which it has been declared.

The scope of a variable can be local as well as global, depending on where a variable is declared. 
A global variable can be available to all the classes and methods within a program while.
A local variable might only be available within the method that it is declared in.

public class MyScopes { //GLOBAL
    static String root = "I'm available to all lines of code within my context";

        public static void main(String[] args) { //LOCAL
           String spy = "I'm a spy";
           //TODO Remove the curly brackets { and }
           
                String insideCurlyBrackets="I'm an insider";
          
           System.out.println(root); 
           System.out.println(spy);
           System.out.println(insideCurlyBrackets);                   
          }
}
