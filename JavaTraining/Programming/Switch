Switch uses what's called cases to compare some value to and make a decision whether an associated block of code needs
to be executed. 
Let's rewrite our if/else if/else example using a switch:

public static void main(String[] args) {
    switch(args.length) {
        case 0: // no argument has been sent
            sayHelloTo("world");
            break;
        case 1: // user has provided one argument on the terminal
            sayHelloTo(args[0]);
            break;
        case 2: // user has provided 2 arguments
            sayHelloTo(args[0] + "-" + args[1]);
            break;
        default: // user has provided more than we can manage!
            System.out.println("Sorry, I don't know how to manage more than 2 names!");
    }
}
