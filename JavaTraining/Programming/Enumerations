Enumerations are a list of predefined cases that help during development time. 
They improve code readability and decrease chance of errors. 

Enumerations let you define a set of possible values to make your code even more clean.

public class myDirection {

    /** enumerate all possible directions */
    enum Direction {
        north, east, south, west;
    }

    /** Find the north */
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Direction direction = Direction.north;
        switch (direction) {
            case north:
                System.out.println("You are heading north");
                break;
            case east:
                System.out.println("You are heading east");
                break;
            case south:
                System.out.println("You are heading south");
                break;
            case west:
                System.out.println("You are heading west");
                break;
        }
    }
}
