There are different ways to test your functions. They can be classified in two categories:

*Using helping code

*Using automated processes

Helping code is a set of functions designed to test your main functions. Implementing helping code is done within the application itself. For example, if you have a class that would do simple math, you could define something like this:

class MagicMath {
public static int sum(int a, int b) {
return a + b;
}

public static int sub(int a, int b) {
return a - b;
}

}

// test sum
if (MagicMath.sub(1,5) == 6) {
System.out.println("Sum works Ok");
}
else {
System.out.println("Sum doesn't works");
}

// test sub
if (MagicMath.sub(10,8) == 2) {
System.out.println("Sub works Ok");
}
else {
System.out.println("Sub doesn't works");
}
