Never use git rebase on a public repository or a branch that others are working on.

Git rebase adds one branch on top of the other with new commits.

Interactive git rebase can be used to manipulate commit history,
change commit messages, combine (squash) commits together, and specify which commits you would like to include in the rebase.

git rebase master
