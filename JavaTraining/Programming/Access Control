The implementation of those frameworks is far beyond what the developers who use them can see and utilize. 
Thatâ€™s done by restricting access to the details of implementation, also known as implementing access control.

CONTROL LEVELS
1) Public: visible to the world and therefore the least restrictive
2) Protected: visible to the package and all its subclasses
3) Package-Protected:typically visible only to the package they are in (default settings)
4) Private: only accessible in the context in which they are defined (inside the class it is located)


class Unicorn {
    // properties
    private int height = 170;
    public String power = "Double.infinity";
    // methods
    private static void sleep() {
    }
    public static void run() {
}
}



The control levels can be assigned to class elements as well as classes:

public class PublicClass {

}

private class PrivateClass {

}
