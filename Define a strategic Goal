# Goals are important.
Don't delay getting started until you find the perfect, ideal learning project. 
Otherwise, you run the risk of never starting, or of changing at the slightest uncertainty.

Unfortunately, willingness and humility are not always sufficient for thorough introspection.
Luck = opportunity + preparation.
"In the middle of difficulty lies opportunity."
