Why use objects as part of other objects?

It is good to modify the blue print of a class without affecting the other class. Example:

Clock--> Battery

"Each attribute is also an OBJECT"

Independent objects used as a part of other objects need a way to communicate.
Since they’re not one and the same, they can’t magically understand what the other object wants or needs without communicating. 

Objects can have attributes that are objects.

These objects also have their own independent blueprint (class), attributes, behaviors, and access.

Objects communicate with one another by sending messages.

Associating objects with other objects allows you to more easily adapt and make changes to your system.
