While loop
It can be interpreted as "as long as the logical expression is true, repeat the instructions."

while (logicalExpression) {
// list of statements
}


1)The program verifies that  logicalExpression is true

2)If it is false: the instructions are ignored. You do not even enter the body of the loop located between {  and  }.

3)If it is true: the list of statements inside { and } are executed.

4)Once the instructions are executed, you return to step one.

int numberOfTrees = 0;

while (numberOfTrees < 10) {
    numberOfTrees += 1;
    System.out.println("I planted " + numberOfTrees + " trees");
}

System.out.println("I have a forest!");


OUTPUT:

I planted 1 trees
I planted 2 trees
I planted 3 trees
I planted 4 trees
I planted 5 trees
I planted 6 trees
I planted 7 trees
I planted 8 trees
I planted 9 trees
I planted 10 trees
I have a forest!
