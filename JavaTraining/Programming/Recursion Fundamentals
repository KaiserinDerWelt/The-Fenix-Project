Recursionn technical terms, recursion is an action that's initialized within itself.
It keeps descending down layer upon layer, until a condition is met and then bubbles back up to the first layer.

5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 

4! = 4 * 3 * 2 * 1

3! = 3 * 2 * 1

Repeats itself from the starting point!!
