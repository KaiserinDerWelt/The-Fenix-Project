The following is important to keep in mind: using while loops can cause a program to crash.
☠️ When the expression remains true forever, the program gets stuck in the loop, causing something called an infinite loop:

boolean theSunIsUp = true;
while (theSunIsUp) {
    print ("Stay awake...forever!"); 
    // theSunIsUp never changes
}
// we never reach this
print ("Go to sleep!");
