How computers solve problems?

Computers canâ€™t actually think, but they can perform billions of logical operations per second. 
These logical operations are written by us and provide the computer with the instructions needed to perform the problem-solving.  
This means you need to think like a computer and translate what you need it to do into program instructions it understands.
