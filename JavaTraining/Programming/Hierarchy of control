public class PublicClass {
    public boolean publicProperty = true;
    int internalProperty = 0; //default at package-private
    private String fileprivateProperty = "Hello!"
    private static void privateMethod() {
    }
}

n the example above, the class is declared as public . 
Since the class is the containing element, this means that all elements of that class may be of the same or lesser level of exposure. 
In this case, it includes all levels.

f you declare a class as private, its elements can only be package-private or private:

A top-level class cannot be marked private.
