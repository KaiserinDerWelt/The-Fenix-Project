 There are a number of ways that the internet can be dangerous.
  # Hackers
 The term “hackers” is a catch-all term nowadays for people who possess advanced technical knowledge of computers and computer systems. Many hackers are well-intentioned, such as those employed to detect security issues in company websites, or even those who hack for social activism.
 
 #Virus
 nstalling firewalls, Antivirus Software, and Anti-Spyware software are a few ways that you can protect your computer.
 
 # Passwords
 Use different passwords.
 No plain words.
 Make your password a sentence including special characters, different letter cases, and numbers.
 * Multi factor authentication
 
 # Wifi
 Wi-Fi is a technology that allows local devices to connect to the internet and the web through radio waves. When using public Wi-Fi networks, many are safe and trustworthy, but don’t let your desire for internet access compromise your personal security. Wi-Fi networks are usually encrypted so that anyone monitoring the wireless traffic cannot see the information exchanged between your devices and the wireless router. Though many have this feature, some do not, and they are usually “open” networks. 

# Permanence
The internet lasts forever, so that awesome photo from that awesome halloween party will last forever too.

Be mindful of the things you post online, because while you can delete things that you no longer want from your personal accounts or computers, information and files cannot be deleted from the web, so anything you post online will still be retrievable on the web when you go to interview for your dream job.
*Things can not be deleted by the WEB*

# Pishing
What is phishing? Phishing is when someone creates a false attempt, most commonly seen in emails, to steal your personal information- credit card numbers, social security numbers, account numbers, passwords, and other sensitive data. Hopefully you wouldn’t just enter this information into a random website that asks you for it, but the technique behind phishing attempts is to mimic a real website, such as the website of your bank.

The hackers will have you enter your information into the false website, which will then be sent to them and not to whomever you thought you were sending your information to. The attempts are usually time sensitive and try to have you enter your information as quickly as possible, as by saying something along the lines of, “If you do not confirm you password and credit card numbers within 48 hours of receiving this email, your account will be locked and inaccessible until we can verify that you are the owner.
