To can use a class in java is necessary to instantiate the class as an object.
I must follow this sintaxys to archieve it:

VariableType VariableName = Keyword ClassName("FIELD VALUES");
An object is called an instance of a class. 

A common way to access fields in many programming languages is using what's called a dot notation.
