Loops:
A loop is a technique that allows you to repeat one or more instructions
Without having to retype the same set of instructions.

There are two types of loops:

Enumerated loops = FOR LOOPS = are used when you know in advance how many times you want to loop.


With these, you can provide the number of iterations to be performed:

As an integer value

As the result of an expression that generates an integer value

For loop with INTEGER VALUE

for (int i=0; i<5;i++) {
    System.out.println("Clap your hands!");
}

i VARIABLE IS RESPONSIBLE OF THE COUNT OF EXECUTIONS.

The general syntax of For loop is:

for (initialization; termination; increment) {
    // list of statements 
}

Iterator variables can have any name. 
For example, i, j, k are common for very general purposes. Otherwise, it's best to use descriptive names, as always!
