Debugging means to eliminate bugs.
Bugs are mistakes in the logic of a program and are both algorithmic and business logic mistakes.

Check Code Manually
- Small scale projects.
- For simple problems.

Random Checks:
This is the tried and true method which is effective on a small scale when you need to fix simple issues. 
And let's face it, you'll use it all the time for quick checks, and it's fine. 
The important part is not using it as a tool to ensure the code quality. 
The most common way of implementing this method is using print function.
They may cause crashes or produce incorrect results. 
Incorrect results are often more dangerous than crashes as they may continue silently happening without an immediate effect.

By the way, using print function for debugging is also called logging.
