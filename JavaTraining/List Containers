The list data type is similar to the array.
List is an ordered container of objects.
The list stores its objects in buckets but does not impose a fixed number of buckets. 

List types
1) ORDERED LIST: Which spot each element is placed on the list matters.
2) UNORDERED LIST: Group these items together, but it doesn't matter which one comes first, last, or fifteenth.
