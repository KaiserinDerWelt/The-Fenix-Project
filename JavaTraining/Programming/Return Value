1) Alter the declaration of the function to indicate that it's expected to return a result.
2) End the function with the return keyword. */

//Once your function is defined, you can use it as many times as you want. Here are a couple of variations:

/*A return value is a result of the function's execution. 
It can be returned to the block of code that called the function and then used as needed.*/
