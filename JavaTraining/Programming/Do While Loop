Do-while loop is very similar to the first one, however, the condition is placed at the end of the corresponding block of code.
This way, the block of code will always be executed at least once.

Do{
//Instructions here!

}While ()



int pushUpGoal = 10;
do{
    print ("Push up!");
    pushUpGoal -= 1;
} while(pushUpGoal > 0);
