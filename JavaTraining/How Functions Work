We need to tell computers what to do and how to do, this is the job of the programmer.

"NO ONE WANT'S TO CODE WHAT ALREADY EXISTS"

Instead, imagine you could take the group of instructions, then reuse them again and again. 
Is what functions do! 

A function allows computer code (your instructions) to be packaged, named, and reused wherever you need it.
 
It wraps code and logic up altogether and assigns it a name.
 
Then, all you have to do is call the function’s name, and ta-da! ✨I

Functions must be focused in acomplishing a specific task. Example "Print Function"
